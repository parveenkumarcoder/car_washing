const FAQS = [
  { q: "How long does a wash take?", a: "Express takes ~15 minutes. Premium ~45 minutes. Full Showroom detailing can take 3-5 hours depending on your car's condition." },
  { q: "Do you really come to my home?", a: "Yes — we bring water, power and all equipment in our mobile unit. We service homes, offices, malls and parking lots." },
  { q: "Is it safe for my paint?", a: "We use pH-neutral foam, microfiber mitts and grit guards. Our trained detailers follow the 2-bucket method to prevent swirls." },
  { q: "How long does ceramic coating last?", a: "Our 9H ceramic coating lasts 2 years with a maintenance wash every 3 months. We offer a written warranty." },
  { q: "What about water usage?", a: "We use less than 2 litres per wash with our steam + foam system — that's 100x less than a traditional wash." },
  { q: "Can I cancel?", a: "Yes, free cancellation up to 2 hours before your slot. After that we charge a small visit fee." },
